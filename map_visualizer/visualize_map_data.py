# TODO: Find a graphics lib that would allow me to render all the pixels from the format.
# Additionally, we want to be able to add the option to zoom, pull up a grid, and bring up 
# a number on the bottom and side to indiciate what pixel we're looking at.
#
# Arguably, we'll need a library that is very flexible and isn't specialized on only one specific
# type of data visualization (e.g. MatLab). 
#
# Potential canidates:
# - PyGame (Handles Mouse and Keyboard Input, Graphics, Sound, etc...) 
# 

# TODO: Write a requirements.txt and move the data visualizer into it's own separate folder.
# Also, maybe write up quick little documentation that provides details on how to use it, 
# what features it includes, etc.

print("Sorry, the visualizer is not operational as of now!")
