# How to use the visualizer.

First, you have to install the requirements for the visualizer.

You can do this with the command on your terminal:
```
pip install -m requirements.txt
```

After that, you should be able to run the following command:
```
python visualize_map_data.py
```

It should open up with a terminal prompt to enter the map file path you want to visualize. (This could change to a different approach in the future). Once, you've entered the file you want to visualize (e.g. 'example.map_data') you should have a window pop up with only black and white pixels.
